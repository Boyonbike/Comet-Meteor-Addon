# Xaero Waypoints

[Documentation index](../README.md) · [Project README](../../README.md)

Module: **xaero-waypoints**. Open **Meteor → Comet → xaero-waypoints**.

A separate module, **xaero-waypoints**, that shows your Meteor waypoints on Xaero's Minimap and World Map. It needs Xaero's Minimap (built against 26.6.0). The World Map draws its waypoints through the minimap, so they appear there too, for whichever dimension the map is showing.

- Each waypoint appears in its own dimension. With Meteor's **opposite** option on, it also appears in the other of Overworld and Nether, at the same ×8 position Meteor uses. Its colour is the closest of Xaero's 21 waypoint colours, and its symbol is the first letter of its name.
- Adding, removing or editing a waypoint in Meteor shows up within half a second. They are display-only: Xaero never writes them to its waypoint files, and they disappear when the module is off. Change them in Meteor. Deleting one from Xaero's menus only hides it in Xaero ("Show Deleted 3rd-Party WPs" brings it back); use **waypoint-delete** or Meteor to delete it for real.
- **show-on-minimap** (default on). Xaero also draws minimap waypoints in the world, so you'll see Xaero's marker as well as Meteor's. Turn this off to keep them on the world map only, or turn off Meteor's **waypoints** module to see only Xaero's.
- **include-hidden** (default off) also shows waypoints whose Meteor visibility is off.

The module list shows how many waypoints are shown. Without Xaero's Minimap it says so and does nothing. If a later Xaero version changes the parts Comet uses, the module turns itself off with a chat message instead of crashing the game.
